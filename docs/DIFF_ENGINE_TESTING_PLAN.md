# Diff Engine Movement and Overlap Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing plan for fixing the diff engine's handling of content movement, resizing, and overlapping scenarios. The core issue is that when UI components move or change size, the old content remains visible, creating visual duplicates and overlaps.

## Problem Statement

The current diff engine generates correct patches (UpdatePropsPatch) when element properties change, but the VirtualDomRenderer's patch application doesn't properly:
1. Clear old content when elements move or resize
2. Handle overlapping scenarios where content shifts position
3. Manage column expansion/contraction scenarios

## Detailed Test Case Categories

### Category 1: Single Element Operations

#### 1.1 Simple Position Movement 🚫

**Test**: `SingleElement_MoveRight_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ·····················  
2 ·····Hello·········
3 ·····················
4 ·····················
```
- Element: Text("Hello") at position (5,2), size (5x1)
- Rendered characters occupy columns 5-9 on row 2

**Change**: Move text right by 3 positions (x: 5→8)

**Expected Diff Engine Behavior**:
1. Detects position change in virtual DOM tree
2. Generates UpdatePropsPatch with old_x=5, new_x=8
3. Patch applied to VirtualDomRenderer

**Expected VirtualDomRenderer Behavior**:
1. Mark old region (5,2,5x1) as dirty for clearing
2. Update RenderedElement coordinates: x=5→8
3. Mark new region (8,2,5x1) as dirty for rendering
4. Call RenderDirtyRegions():
   - Clear (5,2,5x1) with spaces: "     "
   - Render "Hello" at (8,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ·····················  
2 ········Hello······
3 ·····················
4 ·····················
```

**Current Issue**: No clearing occurs, result shows:
```
2 ·····Hello···Hello··  ← DUPLICATION
```

---

**Test**: `SingleElement_MoveDown_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ·····················  
2 ·····Hello·········
3 ·····················
4 ·····················
```

**Change**: Move text down by 1 row (y: 2→3)

**Expected Process**:
1. Clear old position (5,2,5x1)
2. Render at new position (5,3)

**Expected Final State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ·····················  
2 ·····················
3 ·····Hello·········
4 ·····················
```

#### 1.2 Element Resize Operations 🚫

**Test**: `SingleElement_ExpandWidth_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
2 ·····Hi············
```
- Text("Hi") at (5,2), occupies columns 5-6

**Change**: Content changes from "Hi" to "Hello World" (width: 2→11)

**Expected Process**:
1. Detect content change via UpdateTextPatch or UpdatePropsPatch
2. Clear old region (5,2,2x1) - insufficient!
3. **CRITICAL**: Must clear expanded region (5,2,11x1)
4. Render new content "Hello World" at (5,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
2 ·····Hello World···
```

**Test**: `SingleElement_ShrinkWidth_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
2 ·····Hello World···
```

**Change**: Content changes to "Hi" (width: 11→2)

**Expected Process**:
1. Clear full old region (5,2,11x1) - must clear extra chars
2. Render "Hi" at (5,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
2 ·····Hi············
```

### Category 2: Two Element Interactions

#### 2.1 Non-Overlapping Movement 🚫

**Test**: `TwoElements_BothMove_NoOverlap_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ·····················  
2 ··AAA·····BBB······
3 ·····················
4 ·····················
```
- ElementA: Text("AAA") at (2,2), size (3x1)
- ElementB: Text("BBB") at (10,2), size (3x1)

**Change**: Both elements move right by 2 positions
- ElementA: (2,2) → (4,2)
- ElementB: (10,2) → (12,2)

**Expected Process**:
1. UpdatePropsPatch for ElementA: x=2→4
2. UpdatePropsPatch for ElementB: x=10→12
3. Clear old regions: (2,2,3x1) and (10,2,3x1)
4. Render at new positions: (4,2) and (12,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
2 ····AAA·····BBB···
```

#### 2.2 Overlapping Movement (Complex) 🚫

**Test**: `TwoElements_OverlappingMovement_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Terminal Grid (20x5):
01234567890123456789
2 ··AAA·····BBB······
```
- ElementA: Text("AAA") at (2,2), size (3x1) [cols 2-4]
- ElementB: Text("BBB") at (10,2), size (3x1) [cols 10-12]

**Change**: 
- ElementA moves right to (8,2) [will occupy cols 8-10]
- ElementB moves left to (6,2) [will occupy cols 6-8]

**Critical Overlap Analysis**:
- ElementA new position (8,9,10) overlaps ElementB new position (6,7,8) at column 8
- Both elements need to clear their old positions
- Final render must handle the overlap correctly

**Expected Process** (Z-order dependent):
1. Clear ElementA old region (2,2,3x1)
2. Clear ElementB old region (10,2,3x1)
3. Render ElementA at (8,2): "AAA"
4. Render ElementB at (6,2): "BBB" 
5. Result at column 8: depends on render order

**Possible Final States** (depending on z-order):
```
# If ElementA renders last (higher z-index):
2 ······BBAAAA······
        ↑ overlap at column 8: 'A' wins

# If ElementB renders last (higher z-index):
2 ······BBBAA······
        ↑ overlap at column 8: 'B' wins
```

#### 2.3 Chain Reaction Movement 🚫

**Test**: `TwoElements_ChainReaction_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
2 ··AAA·BBB·········
```
- ElementA: Text("AAA") at (2,2) [cols 2-4]
- ElementB: Text("BBB") at (6,2) [cols 6-8]

**Change**: ElementA expands to "AAAAA" (width 3→5)

**Expected Cascade Effect**:
1. ElementA expansion will occupy cols 2-6
2. This overlaps with ElementB at cols 6-8
3. Layout system should detect collision and move ElementB
4. ElementB should move right to avoid overlap: (6,2) → (7,2)

**Expected Process**:
1. ElementA content change triggers UpdateTextPatch
2. Layout recalculation detects ElementB collision
3. ElementB position change triggers UpdatePropsPatch
4. Clear old regions: (2,2,3x1) for ElementA, (6,2,3x1) for ElementB
5. Render: "AAAAA" at (2,2), "BBB" at (7,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
2 ··AAAAA·BBB······
```

### Category 3: Nested Element Hierarchies

#### 3.1 Parent-Child Movement 🚫

**Test**: `NestedElements_ParentMoves_ChildrenFollow_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Virtual DOM Structure:
Container(x=2, y=1, width=8, height=3)
  ├─ HeaderText("Title") at relative (1,0) → absolute (3,1)
  └─ BodyText("Content") at relative (1,1) → absolute (3,2)

Terminal Grid:

0 ·····················
1 ···Title············  
2 ···Content·········
3 ·····················
```

1. Container position: (2,1) → (5,1)
2. HeaderText absolute position: (3,1) → (6,1)
3. BodyText absolute position: (3,2) → (6,2)

**Expected Process**:
1. UpdatePropsPatch for Container: x=2→5
2. VirtualDomRenderer recalculates child positions
3. Clear old regions: (3,1,5x1), (3,2,7x1)
4. Render at new positions: (6,1), (6,2)

**Expected Final State**:
```
01234567890123456789
0 ·····················
1 ······Title·········  
2 ······Content······
3 ·····················
```

#### 3.2 Child Resize Affects Siblings 🚫

**Test**: `NestedElements_ChildExpands_SiblingsShift_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Virtual DOM Structure:
HStack(x=1, y=2)
  ├─ Label1("A") → (1,2)
  ├─ Label2("B") → (2,2)  
  └─ Label3("C") → (3,2)

Terminal Grid:
2 ·ABC················
```

**Change**: Label1 content expands from "A" to "EXPANDED" (width 1→8)

**Expected Layout Recalculation**:
1. Label1: (1,2) width 1→8, stays at (1,2)
2. Label2: shifts right (2,2) → (9,2)
3. Label3: shifts right (3,2) → (10,2)

**Expected Process**:
1. UpdateTextPatch for Label1 content change
2. HStack layout recalculation triggers position updates
3. UpdatePropsPatch for Label2: x=2→9
4. UpdatePropsPatch for Label3: x=3→10
5. Clear old regions: (1,2,1x1), (2,2,1x1), (3,2,1x1)
6. Render at new positions

**Expected Final State**:
```
2 ·EXPANDED·BC·······
```

### Category 4: Multi-Column Table Scenario (Real MultiSelectInput Issue)

#### 4.1 Three-Column Expansion (The Core Problem) 🚫

**Test**: `MultiColumn_FirstColumnExpands_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State** (MultiSelectInput with 3 columns):
```
Terminal Grid (50 chars wide):
01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789

  0-10           15-29             34-46
```

**User Action**: Add "Machine Learning" to Programming column

**Content Change**: 
- Column 1: "Programming" → "Programming\nMachine Learning" 
- Column width increases: 11 → 16 chars (longest line)

**Expected Layout Recalculation**:
1. Column 1: stays at x=0, width 11→16
2. Column 2: shifts right x=15→21 (0+16+5 padding)
3. Column 3: shifts right x=34→42 (21+15+6 padding)

**Critical Clearing Requirements**:
1. Column 2 old area (15-29) must be cleared completely
2. Column 3 old area (34-46) must be cleared completely
3. New content rendered at shifted positions

**Expected Process**:
1. Column 1 content change → UpdateTextPatch
2. Layout engine recalculates column positions
3. Column 2 position change → UpdatePropsPatch x=15→21
4. Column 3 position change → UpdatePropsPatch x=34→42
5. **CRITICAL CLEARING PHASE**:
   - Clear Column 2 old area: (15,2,15x1) with spaces
   - Clear Column 3 old area: (34,2,13x1) with spaces
6. **RENDERING PHASE**:
   - Render Column 1 expanded content at (0,2)
   - Render Column 2 content at (21,2)
   - Render Column 3 content at (42,2)

**Expected Final State**:

### Category 5: Complex Multi-Level Nested Scenarios

#### 5.1 Nested Table with Expanding Cells 🚫

**Test**: `NestedTable_CellExpansion_MultiLevel_DetailedScenario`

**Initial State**:
```
Table(2x2)
├─ Row1
│  ├─ Cell(0,0): HStack["A", "B"]
│  └─ Cell(1,0): Text("X")
└─ Row2  
   ├─ Cell(0,1): Text("C")
   └─ Cell(1,1): Text("Y")

Rendered:
01234567890
0 A·B···X···
1 C·····Y···
```

**Change**: Cell(0,0) HStack first element expands "A" → "ALPHA"

**Expected Cascade**:
1. HStack recalculates: "A","B" spacing changes
2. Cell(0,0) width increases
3. Table column 0 width increases
4. All Row1 Cell(1,0) shifts right
5. All Row2 Cell(1,1) shifts right (column alignment)

**Expected Process** (6 total patches):
1. UpdateTextPatch: "A" → "ALPHA"
2. UpdatePropsPatch: HStack "B" element shifts right
3. UpdatePropsPatch: Cell(1,0) shifts right
4. UpdatePropsPatch: Cell(1,1) shifts right
5. Clear all old positions of shifted elements
6. Render at new calculated positions

**Expected Final State**:
```
01234567890
0 ALPHA·B···X···
1 C·········Y···
```

This comprehensive breakdown shows exactly how each scenario should behave, what clearing operations are required, and what the spatial index needs to detect efficiently.

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix VirtualDomRenderer.VisitUpdateProps ⚠️

**Current Status**: COMPLETED BUT TESTS STILL FAILING
**File**: `/Users/samibengrine/Devel/rivoli-ai/andy-tui/src/Andy.TUI.Terminal/Rendering/VirtualDomRenderer.cs:275`

**Changes Made**:
```csharp
public void VisitUpdateProps(UpdatePropsPatch patch)
{
    // Mark old position as dirty (for clearing)
    _dirtyRegionTracker.MarkDirty(new Rectangle(element.X, element.Y, element.Width, element.Height));
    
    // Track position/size changes and update RenderedElement coordinates
    if (positionChanged)
    {
        element.X = newX; element.Y = newY; 
        element.Width = newWidth; element.Height = newHeight;
        // Mark new position as dirty (for rendering)
        _dirtyRegionTracker.MarkDirty(new Rectangle(newX, newY, newWidth, newHeight));
    }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ Build succeeds, 🚫 Tests still fail - no clearing operations performed

**Issue Identified**: Dirty regions are being marked, but `RenderDirtyRegions()` isn't performing fills.
Possible causes:
1. `RenderDirtyRegions()` method not being called during patch application
2. MockRenderingSystem not capturing `FillRect` calls correctly
3. `DirtyRegionTracker` not properly tracking dirty regions

### Phase 2: Verify Dirty Region Clearing

**Status**: Pending Phase 1 completion
- Ensure `RenderDirtyRegions()` properly clears marked areas with spaces
- Verify clearing happens before new content is drawn

### Phase 3: Handle Complex Overlapping Scenarios  

**Status**: Pending Phase 2 completion
- Test overlapping movement scenarios
- Ensure clearing strategy works for partial overlaps

### Phase 4: Multi-Component Layout Shifts

**Status**: Pending Phase 3 completion  
- Test the real-world MultiSelectInput column expansion scenario
- Verify all shifted columns are properly cleared and redrawn

## Test Execution Order

1. **Build and verify VirtualDomRenderer fix compiles**
2. **Run Category 2 tests** - Should pass after VisitUpdateProps fix
3. **Run Category 3 tests** - Content size changes
4. **Run Category 4 tests** - Overlapping scenarios  
5. **Run Category 5 tests** - Multi-component shifts (the main issue)
6. **Run Category 6 tests** - Complex grid scenarios

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All movement tests pass
- [ ] No visual duplication in MultiSelectInput demo
- [ ] Text components showing bound data update reactively
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable (no excessive clearing/redrawing)

## Current Status Summary

**Overall Progress**: 15% Complete
- ✅ **Diff engine patch generation**: Working correctly
- ⚠️ **VirtualDomRenderer patch application**: Enhanced but tests still failing
- 🚫 **Movement test execution**: Failing - no clearing operations performed
- 🚫 **Real-world testing**: Pending test completion

**STRATEGIC PIVOT**: Moving to Z-Aware Spatial Index Approach
- 📋 **Decision**: Implement Enhanced 3D R-Tree with relative/absolute z-index support
- 📋 **Rationale**: Linear search + flat z-index has fundamental scalability issues
- 📋 **New Requirements**: Support hierarchical z-index resolution for nested components
- 📋 **Reference**: See `SPATIAL_INDEX_DESIGN.md` and `Z_INDEX_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Next Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ Create `SPATIAL_INDEX_DESIGN.md` with R-Tree implementation plan
2. 🔄 Implement basic R-Tree with core spatial operations testing
3. 🔄 Integrate spatial index with VirtualDomRenderer
4. 🔄 Re-run movement tests with spatial approach
5. 🔄 Validate with MultiSelectInput real-world scenario

**Target**: Fix the MultiSelectInput duplication issue using efficient spatial indexing for overlap detection and clearing.
