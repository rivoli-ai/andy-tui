# Layout System Fixes Summary

## Progress Made (January 2025)

### Overall
- Reduced failing tests from 41 to 29 (12 tests fixed)
- Improved Grid, Box, and Text layout implementations

### Box Component
- ✅ Fixed FlexGrow calculation to use parent's actual width instead of constraints
- ✅ Fixed FlexBasis handling for auto-sized boxes
- ✅ Fixed auto-sized boxes to respect tight constraints
- ✅ Fixed content constraints calculation considering padding
- ❌ JustifyContent.SpaceAround still has minor positioning issue (1 test)

### Text Component
- ✅ Fixed MaxWidth to be used as layout width when specified
- ❌ Still have 6 edge case tests failing (truncation, wrapping, etc.)

### Grid Component
- ✅ Implemented proper auto-placement with occupied cell tracking
- ✅ Fixed row span calculation and multi-row spanning
- ✅ Added content-based width calculation (only size to occupied columns)
- ✅ Fixed auto-generation of rows considering explicit placements and spans
- ✅ Added proper constraint shrinking for pixel-sized columns
- ❌ Column span auto-placement wrapping issue (1 test)
- ❌ Tight constraints not properly constraining Box children (1 test)

### Stack Component (VStack/HStack)
- ✅ Basic stacking and spacing works correctly
- ❌ FlexBasis not being respected in HStack (1 test)
- ❌ FlexGrow distribution in VStack needs work (1 test)
- ❌ Multiple spacers distribution has issues (1 test)
- ❌ Mixed sizing (auto + fixed) needs refinement (1 test)
- ❌ Auto-sized children height calculation issue (1 test)

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority (Grid - 2 tests)
1. **Grid_WithColumnSpan_ShouldOccupyMultipleColumns**: Third child placed at X=100 instead of X=0 (should wrap to next row)
2. **Grid_WithTightConstraints_ShouldConstrainChildren**: Box components with fixed dimensions don't respect cell constraints

### Medium Priority (Stack - 5 tests)
1. **HStack_WithFlexBasis_ShouldUseAsInitialSize**: FlexBasis not being used as initial size
2. **VStack_WithFlexChildren_ShouldDistributeSpace**: FlexGrow distribution calculation incorrect
3. **HStack_WithMultipleSpacers_ShouldDistributeEvenly**: Spacer distribution logic needs work
4. **HStack_WithMixedSizing_ShouldHandleCorrectly**: Auto-sized components in HStack
5. **VStack_WithAutoSizedChildren_ShouldSizeToContent**: Height calculation returning 2.0 instead of content height

### Low Priority
1. **Box JustifyContent.SpaceAround**: Minor positioning calculation issue
2. **Text edge cases**: 6 tests for truncation, wrapping, and special cases

## Technical Debt

1. Grid auto-placement could be optimized (currently O(n²) for finding available cells)
2. Constraint propagation could be more consistent across components
3. Some components don't properly handle infinite constraints
4. Need better documentation of layout algorithm behavior

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Grid**: Rewrite auto-placement to properly handle wrapping with spans
2. **Stack**: Implement proper flex algorithm similar to CSS flexbox
3. **Box**: Fix the SpaceAround calculation for edge children
4. **Text**: Implement proper text measurement and wrapping logic
5. **General**: Add visual debugging tools to help diagnose layout issues
